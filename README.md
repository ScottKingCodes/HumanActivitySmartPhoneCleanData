# Human Activity SmartPhone Clean Data 

## Average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Cleaning up data from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

run_analysis.R does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To run the script:

* All files from this page should be downloaded and put into same folder
* Use Rstuido to open the project from run_analysis.R.Rproj
* Working directory should be set to the same folder of this project
* Use source("run_analysis.R")command in console to run the script

For additional details on thought process, please view the Code Book.

"Average for Each Variable.txt" is the resultant independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
